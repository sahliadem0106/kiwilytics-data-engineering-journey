# kiwilytics-data-engineering-journey
Learning data engineering fundamentals - Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib practice , airflow and projects
My progress through the Kiwilytics Data Engineer fundamentals course.

## What I've learned so far:
- Python fundamentals (data structures, comprehensions, generators)
- NumPy for numerical computing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Real-world data wrangling problems

## Structure:
- `python-fundamentals/` - Basic Python concepts and data structures
- `numpy-learning/` - NumPy exercises and practice
- `matplotlib-practice/` - Data visualization with matplotlib
- `pandas-basics/` - Pandas fundamentals and exercises
- `real-world-projects/` - Practical data problems and solutions

## Next:
- Apache Airflow (saving for focused learning)
- Advanced data structures
- Problem solving practice (preparing for coding contests)
